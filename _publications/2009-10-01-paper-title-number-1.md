excerpt: 'Multi-view multi-label classification is a crucial
machine learning paradigm aimed at building robust multi-label
predictors by integrating heterogeneous features from various
sources while addressing multiple correlated labels. However, in
real-world applications, concerns over data confidentiality and
security often prevent data exchange or fusion across different
sources, leading to the challenging issue of data islands. To tackle
this problem, we propose a general federated multi-view multilabel classification method, FMVML, which integrates a novel
multi-view multi-label classification technique into a federated
learning framework. This approach enables cross-view feature
fusion and multi-label semantic classification while preserving the
data privacy of each independent source. Within this federated
framework, we first extract view-specific information from each
individual client to capture unique characteristics and then consolidate consensus information from different views on the global
server to represent shared features. Unlike previous methods, our
approach enhances cross-view fusion and semantic expression by
jointly capturing both feature and semantic aspects of specificity
and commonality. The final label predictions are generated by
combining the view-specific predictions from individual clients
and the consensus predictions from the global server. Extensive experiments across various applications demonstrate that
FMVML fully leverages multi-view data in a privacy-preserving
manner and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.'
